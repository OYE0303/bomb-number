# About the project

This is a bomb number web application. There are three computer players playing the game with users. The main goal of this game is to avoid guessing the bomb number, and user can have different tools to use to win the game. Once guessing the bomb number, the game is over. Hope you enjoy this project.

# The motivation behind the project

When I was learning Javascript, the instructor led the student to build a simple game web application which is simply guessing the correct number in the course. This game is okay, but it’s getting boring quickly because users can follow the logic of binary search to guess the correct number. Therefore, I decided to build another similar game project, but it’s more interesting, and more complicated. That’s why I chose to build this project.

# Project overview

![This is an image](/img/name.png)
&#8594; After entering the game, you can input whatever name you prefer

&nbsp;

![This is an image](/img/level.png)
&#8594; The main difference between these levels is the available counts to use the tools

&#8594; The high level you choose, the less available tool counts you have

&nbsp;

&#8594; Note that you don’t necessarily need to choose your country, you just choose the country you prefer

&#8594; If you don’t want to manually select country, clicking Randomly Select button to randomly select the country for you

&nbsp;

![This is an image](/img/range.png)
&#8594; The number of range determine the range of bomb number

&#8594; If the range is 0 ~ 100, it guarantees that the bomb number is greater than 0 and less than 100

&#8594; Note that if you choose the large number of range, you may spend more time to win the game

&#8594; It’s highly recommend to check the FAQ before playing the game

&#8594; There’s a countdown on top right corner, users have to input a guess number before the countdown finish(become 00:00)

&#8594; If users don’t guess the number before the countdown finish, it will automatically guess a random number for you

&#8594; On the bottom right corner, it shows the current level

&#8594; On the bottom left corner, users can click the button to use the different tools

&#8594; Users can hover over the flag to see the name of the country, and click the info button to see all the information of the country
