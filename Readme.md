# About the project

This is a bomb number web application. There are three computer players playing the game with users. The main goal of this game is to avoid guessing the bomb number, and user can have different tools to use to win the game. Once guessing the bomb number, the game is over. Hope you enjoy this project.

# The motivation behind the project

When I was learning Javascript, the instructor led the student to build a simple game web application which is simply guessing the correct number in the course. This game is okay, but it’s getting boring quickly because users can follow the logic of binary search to guess the correct number. Therefore, I decided to build another similar game project, but it’s more interesting, and more complicated. That’s why I chose to build this project.
